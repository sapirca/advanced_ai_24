# WebArena Replication Project

This repository is dedicated to replicating the results from the WebArena paper. It is an assignment for the Advanced AI course, 2024, taught by Prof. Sarit Kraus. The goal is to rerun the code provided by the authors and verify that we can obtain the same performance metrics reported in their research. 

## Project Goals

* **Code Execution:** Successfully execute the WebArena code on our own environment.
* **Result Replication:** Obtain results that are consistent with those presented in the paper.
